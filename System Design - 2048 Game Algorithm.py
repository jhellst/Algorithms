# 2048 -> Algorithm to solve for

# 2048 is played on a gray 4 Ã— 4 grid with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using one
# of the four arrow keys - Up, Down, Left or Right. On every turn, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 randomly appears on
# an empty spot of the board. After one of the keys is pressed, the tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until
# they are stopped either by another tile or by the edge of the grid. If two tiles with the same number collide while moving,
# they merge into a tile with this number doubled. You can't merge an already merged tile in the same turn. If there are more
# than 2 tiles in the same row (column) that can merge, the farthest (closest to an edge) pair will be merged first (see the second example).

# In this problem you are not going to solve the 2048 puzzle, but you are going to find the final state of the board from the given one after
# a defined set of n arrow key presses, assuming that no new random tiles will appear on the empty spots.


# Steps:
#   1) Iterate through all of the "directions" provided in path.
