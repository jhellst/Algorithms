# You are given a 2D integer array descriptions where descriptions[i] = [parenti, childi, isLefti] indicates that parenti is the parent of childi in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore,

# If isLefti == 1, then childi is the left child of parenti.
# If isLefti == 0, then childi is the right child of parenti.
# Construct the binary tree described by descriptions and return its root.

# The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is valid.

# Example 1:

# Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]]
# Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19]
# Explanation: The root node is the node with value 50 since it has no parent.
# The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.

# Example 2:

# Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]]
# Output: [1,2,null,null,3,4]
# Explanation: The root node is the node with value 1 since it has no parent.
# The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= descriptions.length <= 104
# descriptions[i].length == 3
# 1 <= parenti, childi <= 105
# 0 <= isLefti <= 1
# The binary tree described by descriptions is valid.
